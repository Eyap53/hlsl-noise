# HSLS-Noise

This repo aims to provide optimized hlsl translations of the glsl perlin noises (classic and simplex) implemented in this repo : https://github.com/ashima/webgl-noise/.

I decided to create this repo because the hsls noise projects that I found were either not maintained, not optimized, and/or not stating a license (thus not usable).

## Licensing

As stated above, this work is based on the webgl-noise written by Stefan Gustavson and Ahima Arts: https://github.com/ashima/webgl-noise, licensed under the MIT License. You can find more explanation about the algorithms inside [their wiki](https://github.com/ashima/webgl-noise/wiki).

These hlsl implementations are licensed under the MIT license.
